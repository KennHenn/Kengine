    <h2>Post Mortem</h2>
    <p>If I were to take this project further, I would do a complete overhaul of the engine. Rather than having it primarily based in C++, I would rely more on python and pybind functionality. Due to early design choices I wound up locked out of using python due to my Game Object structure and how saving and loading scenes worked. In addition, I may switch off from Dear ImGui to a python-based GUI library to make a runtime live GUI more compatible with the newly implemented python game objects. In doing so, I can make the engine more versatile by allowing for the inclusion of more customization in gameplay logic from the user’s end.</p>
    <p>As for what went well, I am very happy with how the engine turned out visually. I think the use of information on both sides and the game/scene in the middle is a nice sleek look. Plus, even with my limitations in terms of customizable game objects, I think my inclusion of four additional blocks to make the gameplay more interesting to design was a nice touch that both enhances the building and playing experience.</p>
    <p>If given another month on this project, I would work on that overhaul mentioned above. I believe the main hiccup that plagued this version of the project was a lack of foresight in the design stages. Thus, if given the chance to work on it for longer, I would spend more time carefully planning out the design instead of the “ad-libbing” process that I incorporated into this version. Plus, now that I better understand how to make the moving parts of a game engine, as well as some experience with UI and documentation, I think that I could make a much more cleaner and flexible product the next time I’m given the chance.</p>

    <br>
    <p>To Run the Engine, use the command "<i>python3 kenscript.py</i>"</p>
    <p>To Complile the Engine, use the command "<i>clang++ -shared -fPIC -std=c++20 -I./pybind11/include/ -I./include/ `python3.10 -m pybind11 --includes` src/*.cpp -o kengine.so `pkg-config --libs --cflags sdl3` `python3.10-config --ldflags`</i>"</p>
